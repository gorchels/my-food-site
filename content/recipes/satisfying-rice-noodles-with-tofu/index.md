directions:
- Chop tofu into cubes while heating up oil in a large frying pan or wok. 
- Add tofu and a few splashes of soy sauce, flipping the sides of the tofu around to evenly cook. 
- While tofu is cooking, chop your vegetables and start boiling a pot of water for your noodles.
- Remove tofu from pan and add your vegetables (optional: and a few more splashes of soil sauce). Saute   the vegetables for 5 minutes then put a lid on the pan to steam them. Reduce heat. 
- While vegetables are steaming, cook the rice noodles for 5 minutes. Make sure to strain them before      they get too soft. 
- In a small bowl, whisk your soy sauce, brown sugar, chili sauce, and lime juice. 
- Remove veggies and refresh pan with a little more oil if necessary. While the pan is warming up again, chop your ginger and garlic. Saute. 
- After the ginger and garlic are fragrant (about 5 minutes) add your rice noodles. Stir and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add your sauce. Stir until the noodles are fully coated. 
- While noodles are cooking, chop your cilantro and scallions. 
- Create a hole in the noodles and scramble your eggs in the hole. Once cooked, mix the eggs in with the noodles. Add in vegetables, tofu, scallions, cilantro, and peanuts. 
- Garnish with extra cilantro and serve with soy and chili sauce.
